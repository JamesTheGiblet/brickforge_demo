## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains the **public-facing web clients** for the **BlockForge Studio** platform. It is a suite of lightweight, high-performance 3D visualizers built with **Three.js** that allow users to design, customize, and build brick-based products.

**Note:** This is the *frontend display layer*. The heavy engineering logic (STL-to-Voxel conversion, Greedy Tiling optimization, and Baseplate generation) resides in our private **BlockForge Pro** desktop engine.

## 🚀 The 6-Product Suite

We have expanded beyond simple 3D models. The platform now includes six specialized engines:

| Tool | Function | Target Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. 🧊 3D Studio** | **STL to Bricks** | Custom mascots, toys, and complex geometry. |
| **2. 🖼️ Mosaic Studio** | **Photo to Pixel Art** | Pet portraits, wedding gifts, and wall art. |
| **3. 🏔️ Relief Studio** | **Image to Topography** | 3D bas-relief maps and textured art. |
| **4. 📱 Connect Studio** | **Functional QR Codes** | Scannable brick signs for cafes & hotels. |
| **5. 🔠 Sign Studio** | **Text to 3D Structure** | Vertical desk nameplates and office signage. |
| **6. 🏠 Architect Studio** | **Photo to Facade** | High-end closing gifts for Realtors. |

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧸 Interactive 3D Designer:** Rotate, zoom, and pan around complex brick models.
* **🎨 Click-to-Paint:** Intuitive coloring system with palette management.
* **⚡ Real-Time Logic:** Instantly calculates part counts (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) and pricing as you paint.
* **📂 Dynamic JSON Loading:** Capable of importing custom `model.json` files generated by the backend engine.
* **📄 Auto-Instructions:** Generates step-by-step PDF build guides directly in the browser.
* **💾 STL Export:** Generates custom 3D-printable baseplates for non-standard shapes.

## 🏗️ How It Works (The Architecture)

The BlockForge ecosystem consists of two parts. This repository is **Part 2**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] -->|STL / Image / Text| B(BlockForge Engine);
    B -->|Voxelize & Optimize| C{JSON / Geometry};
    C -->|Import| D[This Web Suite];
    D -->|Paint & Configure| E[Final Order / PDF];
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
````

1. **The Backend (Private):** We process raw data (STLs, Images, Text) using Python & NumPy to generate optimized brick structures.
2. **The Data Handoff:** The backend exports a lightweight JSON definition.
3. **The Frontend (This Repo):** The web client parses the JSON and reconstructs the model using Three.js geometry for user interaction.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You can run this demo locally without any build steps (No Node.js/NPM required).

1. **Clone the repo**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/brickforge_demo.git
    ```

2. **Run**
    Simply double-click `index.html` or serve it via a local server.

    ```bash
    # If using Python
    python -m http.server
    ```

3. **Explore**
    The `index.html` file acts as a **Hub**, linking to the 6 individual tools (`3d.html`, `mosaic.html`, `qr.html`, etc.).

## 🎮 Live Demo Models

The demo comes pre-loaded with example assets generated by our engine:

* **The Bear** 🧸 (\~450 Bricks) - Demonstrates complex curves.
* **The BadAss Sign** 🔠 (\~200 Bricks) - Demonstrates vertical stacking logic.
* **The WiFi Code** 📱 (\~1000 Tiles) - Demonstrates functional scanning contrast.

---

## 💻 Technical Highlights

* **Zero Dependencies:** Built with Vanilla JavaScript and Three.js via CDN. Fast load times, no bloat.
* **Raycasting:** Optimized pixel-perfect brick selection for the 3D painter.
* **Client-Side Generation:** PDF instructions and STL baseplates are generated 100% in the browser.
