🎨 BlockForge Web Client (Demo)

    The Interactive Frontend for the BlockForge Studio Suite. Experience the 3D customization engine directly in your browser.

📖 About This Repository

This repository contains the public-facing web client for the BlockForge Studio platform. It is a lightweight, high-performance 3D visualizer built with Three.js that allows users to customize, paint, and order brick-based models.

Note: This is the frontend display layer only. The heavy engineering logic (STL-to-Voxel conversion, Greedy Tiling optimization, and Baseplate generation) resides in our private BlockForge Pro desktop engine.
✨ Features

    🧸 Interactive 3D Designer: Rotate, zoom, and pan around complex brick models.

    🎨 Click-to-Paint: Intuitive coloring system with palette management.

    ⚡ Real-Time Logic: Instantly calculates part counts (1x1, 1x2, 1x3) and pricing as you paint.

    📂 Dynamic JSON Loading: Capable of importing custom model.json files generated by the backend engine.

    📱 Mobile Responsive: Fully touch-optimized for tablets and phones.

    📸 Image Export: One-click export of Front/Back/Side views for manufacturing or sharing.

🏗️ How It Works (The Architecture)

The BlockForge ecosystem consists of two parts. This repository is Part 2.

    The Backend (Private): We process raw 3D files using Python & NumPy to generate optimized brick structures.

    The Data Handoff: The backend exports a lightweight JSON definition.

    The Frontend (This Repo): The web client parses the JSON and reconstructs the model using Three.js geometry for user interaction.

🚀 Quick Start

You can run this demo locally without any build steps (No Node.js/NPM required).

    Clone the repo
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/brickforge_demo.git

Run Simply double-click index.html or serve it via a local server.
Bash

    # If using Python
    python -m http.server

    Import Custom Models Use the "Import" panel in the sidebar to load your own model.json files.

🎮 Try The Live Models

The demo comes pre-loaded with two example models generated by our engine:
Model	Part Count	Description
The Bear 🧸	~450 Bricks	Demonstrates complex curves and organic shapes.
The Penguin 🐧	~280 Bricks	Shows multi-color capabilities and stability logic.
💻 Technical Highlights

    Zero Dependencies: Built with Vanilla JavaScript and Three.js via CDN. Fast load times, no bloat.

    Raycasting: optimized pixel-perfect brick selection.

    Instanced Mesh Logic: (Roadmap) Planning to upgrade to InstancedMesh for rendering 10,000+ brick models.
